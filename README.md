# Project Overview: 
The aim of our project is to develop a machine learning algorithm to sort through the New York realtor data set to establish a relationship between the house features (house size (square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size (acres), and city) and price of the home.

### Research Question: 
#### Which features have the greatest impact on home price (house size (square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size (acres), and city)?
